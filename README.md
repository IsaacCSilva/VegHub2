# VeggieID Running 

## IMPORTANT
    This is the code that we demoed in the final presentation.
    This is the functioning repostory the DOES NOT connect to the backend and only contain the frontend and functionality.
    If you would like to see the code that attempts to connect to the backend (it does not work), please refer to:
    https://github.com/zance1054/VegIDMERN/new/donttouchthis/

## Prerequistes

    ensure that you have the node package manager installed and configutred in your console
    
    https://nodejs.org/en/
    
    Additionally, you need a relatively new android version (running a recent update within the last year). This is due to React-Native's nature and making the application available for older versions is a completely new task to take on. 
    
## Clone the repo

    https://github.com/kimwilsonngo/VegHub2/tree/donttouch
    
## npm modules

    open terminal and navigate to the repos directory
    
    i.e. cd backend
    
    then run the following commands to install the packages
    
    npm install
    
    npm link
    
## run the application

    react-native run-android
    
This should launch the application onto your device or emulator. If you get any gradle.bat installDebug issues, go to the root folder, then "cd android && chmod +x gradlew." Return back to the root folder and "react-native run-android." 

Thank you!
